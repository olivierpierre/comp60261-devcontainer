# COMP60261 Part 1: Lecture Code Snippets

This repository contains running examples for all the code snippets presented in the [lecture slides](https://olivierpierre.github.io/comp60261/) of the C part of COMP60261.

To explore and run these code examples directly in your browser you can use GitHubCodespaces.
It is normally a paid feature but you can get access to it for free with a [student](https://education.github.com/pack/?WT.mc_id=academic-81409-leestott) account.

Go to the [repository](https://github.com/olivierpierre/comp60261-devcontainer) page on GitHub, and click on `Use this template` then `Open in a codespace`:
